# WeatherPlannerDashboard
## Description
- The purpose of this project was to create a dashboard that provided a 5 day forecast to users of their selected cities.
- This assignment shows how data can be acquired from servers and taken to populate your own webpages.
- The issue that gave me the most difficulty was converting the data I pulled from the API and getting it to populate the dashboard.  
- Through-out this project I learned a repeatable process for accessing and displaying data retrieved by an API call.  I also furthered my abilities to dynamically generate elements on the page.
